      faqs: [
        {
          question: 'What is the Weighing balance?',
          answer: 'The principle of a rotary evaporator is based on reducing the pressure inside the system using a vacuum, which in turn lowers the boiling point of solvents. This allows evaporation to occur at significantly lower temperatures, making the process ideal for heat-sensitive materials. A round-bottom flask containing the solution is rotated in a heated water bath. The rotation increases the surface area of the liquid and ensures even heat distribution, preventing bumping or boiling over. As the solvent evaporates, it travels through a condenser where it is cooled and then collected in a separate receiving flask. This method is highly effective for concentrating, purifying, or recovering solvents in applications such as organic synthesis, natural product extraction, and analytical chemistry. The process preserves the integrity of delicate compounds and improves efficiency in laboratory workflows.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What is the working procedure of a rotary evaporator?',
          answer: 'The working procedure of a rotary evaporator involves several coordinated steps to achieve safe and efficient solvent evaporation. First, the solution is poured into a round-bottom flask, which is securely attached to the evaporator’s rotating motor. The flask is then partially immersed in a heated water bath to promote evaporation. At the same time, a vacuum pump is engaged to reduce the pressure within the system, lowering the boiling point of the solvent. The flask is rotated to maximize surface area, allowing uniform heating and faster evaporation. The solvent vapor then passes through a condenser where it is cooled and converted back into liquid, collected in a receiving flask. This process enables users to remove solvents at lower temperatures, reducing thermal stress on the sample. It is commonly used in pharmaceutical development, sample concentration, and chemical research.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What are the top 10 applications where a rotary evaporator can be used?',
          answer: `Rotary evaporators are widely used across diverse scientific and industrial fields due to their versatility and efficiency. Top 10 applications include:

1. Organic synthesis for removing solvents after reactions,
2. Pharmaceutical research for purifying APIs,
3. Cannabis and herbal industries for extracting and concentrating bioactives,
4. Food and beverage R&D for aroma and flavor concentration,
5. Environmental analysis for concentrating trace-level pollutants,
6. Toxicology and forensic labs for isolating and analyzing samples,
7. Cosmetic industry for formulating active ingredients and essential oils,
8. Contract Research Organizations (CROs) for standardized and scalable solvent removal,
9. Academic institutions for lab teaching and training,
10. Petrochemical sector for analyzing and refining chemical compounds.

These applications highlight the instrument's crucial role in both routine and complex processes.`

        {
          question: 'What is the principle of a rotary evaporator?',
          answer: 'The principle of a rotary evaporator is based on reducing the pressure inside the system using a vacuum, which in turn lowers the boiling point of solvents. This allows evaporation to occur at significantly lower temperatures, making the process ideal for heat-sensitive materials. A round-bottom flask containing the solution is rotated in a heated water bath. The rotation increases the surface area of the liquid and ensures even heat distribution, preventing bumping or boiling over. As the solvent evaporates, it travels through a condenser where it is cooled and then collected in a separate receiving flask. This method is highly effective for concentrating, purifying, or recovering solvents in applications such as organic synthesis, natural product extraction, and analytical chemistry. The process preserves the integrity of delicate compounds and improves efficiency in laboratory workflows.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What is the working procedure of a rotary evaporator?',
          answer: 'The working procedure of a rotary evaporator involves several coordinated steps to achieve safe and efficient solvent evaporation. First, the solution is poured into a round-bottom flask, which is securely attached to the evaporator’s rotating motor. The flask is then partially immersed in a heated water bath to promote evaporation. At the same time, a vacuum pump is engaged to reduce the pressure within the system, lowering the boiling point of the solvent. The flask is rotated to maximize surface area, allowing uniform heating and faster evaporation. The solvent vapor then passes through a condenser where it is cooled and converted back into liquid, collected in a receiving flask. This process enables users to remove solvents at lower temperatures, reducing thermal stress on the sample. It is commonly used in pharmaceutical development, sample concentration, and chemical research.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What are the top 10 applications where a rotary evaporator can be used?',
          answer: `Rotary evaporators are widely used across diverse scientific and industrial fields due to their versatility and efficiency. Top 10 applications include:

1. Organic synthesis for removing solvents after reactions,
2. Pharmaceutical research for purifying APIs,
3. Cannabis and herbal industries for extracting and concentrating bioactives,
4. Food and beverage R&D for aroma and flavor concentration,
5. Environmental analysis for concentrating trace-level pollutants,
6. Toxicology and forensic labs for isolating and analyzing samples,
7. Cosmetic industry for formulating active ingredients and essential oils,
8. Contract Research Organizations (CROs) for standardized and scalable solvent removal,
9. Academic institutions for lab teaching and training,
10. Petrochemical sector for analyzing and refining chemical compounds.

These applications highlight the instrument's crucial role in both routine and complex processes.`
