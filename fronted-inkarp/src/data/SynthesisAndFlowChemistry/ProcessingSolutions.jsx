                question: "What is Hei-PROCESS Expert and how is it different from Hei-PROCESS Core?",
                answer:
                    "Hei-PROCESS Expert is an advanced automation platform by Heidolph designed for laboratories and industrial environments that require dynamic, parameter-based process control. Unlike Hei-PROCESS Core, which operates using time-based recipe steps, the Expert variant allows process transitions to occur based on real-time sensor data such as pH, temperature, or flow rate. This means the system can respond immediately when a certain condition is met, triggering the next phase in the workflow automatically. Hei-PROCESS Expert is ideal for sensitive or variable experiments where real-time responsiveness is essential. It also supports the integration of third-party measuring instruments, fixed configuration assemblies, and cloud-based remote monitoring. For Indian laboratories, Inkarp Instruments Pvt Ltd provides full distribution, setup, and service support for this cutting-edge system.",

                question: "How does parameter-dependent control benefit laboratory workflows?",
                answer:
                    "Parameter-dependent control allows automation steps to be triggered by real-time data from sensors monitoring critical variables such as pH, temperature, or pressure. This is particularly useful in workflows like chemical synthesis, fermentation, or pH-titrated reactions, where a process should only advance once certain conditions are met. Instead of relying on static timers, Hei-PROCESS Expert enables a responsive, adaptive process structure, ensuring better accuracy and efficiency. This method reduces the chances of premature or delayed transitions, improves consistency across runs, and supports better quality assurance in regulated environments. With parameter-based logic, users can fine-tune automation workflows to reflect the nuances of real experimental conditions.",

                answer:
                    "Fixed configuration assemblies refer to predefined combinations of Heidolph instruments and sensors that function as a single synchronized process unit. These configurations are programmed to operate in tandem, ensuring that each component performs its role within the same process context. For example, a rotary evaporator could be paired with a temperature sensor and dosing pump, all functioning under a unified control logic. This synchronized operation eliminates inconsistencies, enhances reproducibility, and reduces human error during multi-device coordination. It also simplifies setup for recurring processes, making it ideal for high-throughput labs or automated production settings.",
