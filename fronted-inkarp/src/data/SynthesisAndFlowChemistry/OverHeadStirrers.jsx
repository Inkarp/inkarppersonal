            {
                question: "How does the torque trend display benefit laboratory processes?",
                answer: "The torque trend display on the Hei-TORQUE Expert 100 visually represents changes in sample resistance during stirring in real-time. This function is especially valuable in analytical and formulation labs where the viscosity of the media can change dynamically during a chemical or physical reaction. For example, if a formulation begins to thicken, the bar indicator will rise, signaling increased torque. This allows researchers to respond immediately by adjusting speed or formulation inputs. It is also helpful in scaling up processes where torque limits must be observed for safety and reproducibility. This feature gives users more control and insight into the mixing process, unlike basic stirrers that operate blind to internal changes."

                question: "How does the torque trend display enhance lab performance?",
                answer: "The torque trend display is a key feature that visually indicates the resistance experienced during mixing in real time. As viscosity changes in your sample—due to temperature, chemical reaction, or component addition—the bar on the display reflects the shift in torque. This helps users monitor the behavior of the sample and make immediate adjustments if necessary. For example, if a reaction thickens unexpectedly, the rising torque signal warns the operator to reduce speed or modify the formulation. It provides an added level of process insight and control, crucial for applications that demand high accuracy and consistency."
