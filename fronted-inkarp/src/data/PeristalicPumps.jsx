                answer: "The Hei-FLOW Core 120 is a laboratory-grade peristaltic pump from Heidolph designed for precise, contamination-free media transfer. It operates by compressing flexible tubing in a wave-like motion using rotating rollers, pushing liquid forward with high accuracy and minimal shear stress. The pump supports both single-channel and multi-channel pump heads, making it adaptable to various flow needs. With adjustable speeds (10–120 rpm) and flow rates (up to 861 ml/min), it’s ideal for both low-volume and high-throughput applications. The directional control allows fluid to be moved forward or in reverse with a simple button press. Its modular pump head system and maintenance-free drive make it a versatile and durable solution for labs handling sensitive, viscous, or sterile liquids."
